# A "Simple" script that will allow me to deploy a PHP 7.x / Laravel app to a VPS from Github with next to no config.

# Please don't shout at me saying that there are more efficient ways / better scripts out there that I could use. I don't care.

# If you stumble across this script and don't know what you're doing, I take no responsibility for anything that you mess up.

# Check the "licence" file for more information.
