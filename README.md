# DeployBot - A "Simple" Server Deployment Script

DeployBot is a simple ish script that I'm writing that contains all the commands that I'll need in order to deploy a Laravel application.

Please Note that steps / commands will almost certainly vary depending on your Linux / software versions.

# How to use:

Just clone the repo onto your Ubuntu / Debian VPS with ``git clone https://github.com/UpperCenter/DeployBot.git``

# To-Do:

  - Get the thing working lmao
  - Be able to add configuration files from a set source
  - Add some colours maybe
